# Markdown Benchmark

This is a baseline benchmark for tracking Markdown performance in the Gabe project.

The site can generate an arbitrary amount of super simple pages. Each page has a small header, a quote, and two small paragraphs of random text. No images, because we want to benchmark Markdown.

This uses the local file system plugin, though we might switch to sourcing from csv since that has a more efficient internal representation (fewer `File` nodes).

## Install

Run `yarn` or `npm install`

## Usage

You can start a benchmark run like this:

```shell
N=1000 M=2 yarn bench
```

- `N=1000`: instructs the run to build a site of 1000 pages
- `M=2`: instructs nodejs to use up to 2gb of memory for its long term storage
- Deletes generates files from previous run
- Generates `N` pages with pseudo-random content
- Runs `gatsby clean`
- Runs `gatsby build`

The default `yarn bench` will build 512 pages with 1gb memory.
